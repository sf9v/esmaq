// NOTES:
// - i don't like the callback initialization
// - maybe we can make all params (except context) including
// - should we consider the callback action and enter the same?
// 	coz they seem to have similar purpose from state as single struct
// - integrate with go generate?
// - consider adding a get current state function so we don't need to always include
// 	the from state in the context, but make it optional
// - dot graphs
